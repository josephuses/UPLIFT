\chapter{ORGANIZING A MATH FIELD TRIP}
\section*{INTRODUCTION}
This module presents a guide on how to organize a field trip for Mathematics class. This
encourages the teacher to have an excursion as an alternative activity to promote learning in
Mathematics. This also emphasizes that experience is the best education thus, when students actually
apply their knowledge in a setting outside of school, these experiences strengthen their learning
experience.
\section*{OBJECTIVES}

\section*{DISCUSSION}
\subsection*{Importance of Field Trips}
Field trips can be a wonderful avenue for students to have a firsthand experience on the areas
of the subject matter. It is an opportunity for the students to explore the rich resources of the local
community. Through such, studentsâ€™ knowledge and understanding of the subject will increase while
exposing them to reality. Moreover, certain values such as sense of responsibility, independence, team
work and cooperation among students will be developed.
